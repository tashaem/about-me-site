            <p class="big">my name is natasha.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Indonesia. Thanks to a really passionate high school teacher,
            I fell in love with Physics and am currently chasing an Engineering degree in Hong Kong. I'm taking this CS50w course
            to upskill during my time in quarantine, which I'm sure a lot of other people are also doing to remain productive this season.
            Not sure what else to say. My hometown is due to be fully underwater by 2050, so that's something.
            Climate change, huh? If you're still reading, <em id="click" onclick="func();">click here!</em></p>
             <div id="bootstrapAlert">
               <!-- alert goes here if the above "click me!" is clicked-->
            </div>
            <div id="quote">"My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; <br>and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style."
