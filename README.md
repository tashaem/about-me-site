Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is an "About Me" project with 4 different web pages that can be accessed through the 'sidebar' provided
across all 4 pages. 

1. index.html =  Intended "Home" page you'd want to open first. The page holds a short description about me (not really).
2. hobbies.html = contains a list of my hobbies and how I spend my time.
3. favorites.html = displays the posters of my favorite book, movie, and tv show.
4. link4.html = holds a table of random links.
